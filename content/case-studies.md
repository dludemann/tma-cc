        It might be hard to believe that we can get the results for our clients
        that we claim, so we've put together some specific results driven case
        studies to show the life change with new photos.

      - text: >-
          Karthik reached out a few weeks ago with a plan. He wanted to get some
          incredible photos of him and his girlfriend of just over two years—but
          sneak in a proposal at the end. So Allie and I flew out to San
          Francisco We were a bit nervous with how much it was raining, but it
          turned out to be the most perfect day to fit our moody and more
          intense photo style.

          > When I first started implementing the photos, it was pretty much
          instant results. Nowadays I can pretty much get dates when I want
          them.... like how many dates do I want to go on this week?..... They
          coach you on how to have the best looks for your photos. This is
          something I had no idea about. Now when I'm taking pictures with
          friends, I know how to bring out the most attractive looks.
