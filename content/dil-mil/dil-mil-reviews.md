## What Is Dil Mil?

\\n

[Dil Mil]("https://dilmil.co/") is a dating app aimed at South Asian singles looking for love and relationships. It helps to connect Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Malayali, Maharashtrian, and other ethnic groups from India and across the globe.

\\n

\\n

A large number of users are Indian ex-pats, based in a range of countries and regions in the west including the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, and UAE.

\\n

\\n

According to this [Forbes]("https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeescobedo/2017/05/04/this-app-is-using-artificial-intelligence-social-media-to-help-south-asians-find-love/?sh=51144b4f48e1") article, the creators of the app wanted Dil Mil to be a middle ground for South Asian singles between casual dating and pressure for arranged marriages.

\\n

\\n

To use the app, users can create a profile, upload pictures and share content about themselves, including their age, education, and religious background. The app’s algorithms then use the data to find potential matches.

\\n

\\n

Users can swipe right if they like a profile or left if they don’t, similar to on Tinder. It’s all about creating connections!

\\n

\\n

As well as the basic free version of the app, Dil Mil also offers a VIP Elite subscription, which gives users access to features that include [Super Likes]("https://dilmil.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-dil-mil/faq/289-what-are-super-likes-1578531335/#:~:text=Super%20Liking%20a%20person%20shows,time%20they%20use%20the%20app."), Boosts, and Dil Details, and also lets users see who liked their profile.

## User Reviews of Dil Mil

\\n

User feedback on Dil Mil is pretty varied, with some users absolutely loving the app and some hating it!

\\n

\\n

There is quite a big difference between how Android and iPhone users feel about the app, with an overall 4 star rating on the App Store as opposed to a 2 star rating on Google Play.

\\n

\\n

Let’s look a bit closer at the reviews.

\\n

### [App Store Reviews]("https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dil-mil-south-asian-dating/id879383901?see-all=reviews")

\\n

Reports from the App store are quite varied, with some loving the app and some thinking it needs work.

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    More than one reviewer left a 5-star review and said that the app worked so well for them they’re now getting married 

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    One user said that the app was great for them as they lived in a community with few South Asian people, so it was a good way for them to connect with someone from their community

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    Another user raved about the app and said they met their fiancée through it

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    Some reviewers were not as positive — one user felt that the app had too many rules and there were too many fake accounts. They also believed their profile was not getting shown to others

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    Another user said that the app was great when it came out, but now it is too focused on money making, with too many fees. 

    \\n

\\n

\\n

### [Google Play Reviews]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.dilmil.android&hl=en_CA&gl=US&pli=1")

\\n

The biggest complaint from Google Play reviewers is that the app is buggy, however some have positive experiences!

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    Several users said that the app is buggy, glitchy, lags and freezes a lot

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    One user complained that the features are too limited, even if you pay for VIP Elite

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

\\n\* \\n

    One other user who liked the premise of the app and the features, still complained it was buggy. 

    \\n

\\n

\\n

\\n

Judging by these answers, it sounds like the Android version needs some work!

\\n

## User Complaints About Dil Mil

\\n

A lot of user complaints about Dil Mil are about the performance of the app, not the idea itself.

\\n

\\n

On one [Reddit thread]("https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/j147j5/what_are_your_experiences_using_dilmil/"), a lot of Redditors had criticism about the app’s user experience, while others thought they got better results from Tinder or Hinge.

\\n

\\n

On another [Reddit thread]("https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/yhi9es/dil_mil_review_thread/"), users criticized the app’s location features, saying it often matched users with others who did not live in the same area — sometimes matches lived huge distances away! Others criticized the fact that the free version doesn’t have many features.

\\n

\\n

On a separate [thread]("https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/s85r1a/dil_mil_premium_is_it_worth_it/") about whether Dil Mil premium is worth it, most users seemed to think it wasn’t, citing the app’s bugs as the main reason.

\\n

\\n

One [user]("https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/s85r1a/comment/hw9rcf8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"), however, thought Premium was worth it and that he was getting more matches with his premium features’ purchases than with the free version.

\\n

## Dil Mil from a Guy’s Perspective

\\n

From a guy’s perspective, once you’ve created your profile and specified your preferences, the app will present you with a range of women’s profiles to review. You can then use the swiping feature to like or pass on each profile.

\\n

\\n

When you swipe right (like) on someone, and they do the same, a match is created. Now you can start a conversation, chat, ask questions, share likes and dislikes, and get to know each other through messaging.

\\n

\\n

Although some [users]("https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/yhi9es/comment/iyq7l4r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button") think the app is only worthwhile for the most good-looking guys, others claim it was the solution to being single — they found their wives through the app!

\\n

## Dil Mil from a Woman’s Perspective

\\n

From a woman’s perspective, the process is the same.

\\n

\\n

After creating your account, the app will provide you with men’s profiles based on your preferences. If you come across a profile that piques your interest, swipe right. If there’s a mutual like, a match is formed, and you can begin sending messages to each other.

\\n

\\n

In both cases, users have the option to purchase the VIP Elite membership for access to premium features.

\\n

\\n

This includes Super Likes to stand out from the crowd, and Boosts to increase the visibility of your profile. Both men and women can use these features to increase their chances of finding the right match.

\\n

## How Does Dil Mil’s Price Compare to Other Apps

\\n

The cost of a Dil Mil premium accounts start at payments of [$16.67]("https://healthyframework.com/dating/review/dil-mil/") a month — but that’s only if you sign up for an entire year.
