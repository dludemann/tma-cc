<p>Let&rsquo;s dive right in!</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What Is Dil Mil?</h2>
<p>Dil Mil is a dating site, aimed at expat South Asians looking for long-term relationships, love, and marriage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil functions in much the same way as other popular dating apps, such as Tinder and Hinge, and uses the same swiping system to match users (so you won&rsquo;t be able to search for specific users). Just swipe right to like a profile, or left to pass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can upload up to six photos on your profile, as well as adjust your location settings. While you can&rsquo;t set a radius on your location, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to try to keep your settings as close to your location as possible. That way, if you match with someone, it&rsquo;ll be easier to facilitate a potential IRL date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once users mutually like each other, you&rsquo;ll be placed into a private chat room where you&rsquo;ll be able to message each other, strike up a conversation, and start chatting. Your first message is incredibly important as there are a large number of users on the platform, so you&rsquo;ll need to capture the other person&rsquo;s attention quickly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil used a proprietary algorithm, ie, data you provide upon registration is the basis for results. One of Dil Mil&rsquo;s points of difference is the sheer amount of filters you can put in place. It makes sense when you think about it &mdash; the majority of users are looking for someone to take home to their family, after all, so it makes sense that some criteria should be in place!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The basic version of Dil Mil is free to use. However, in order to have the option to access more swipes per day (you&rsquo;re limited to 10 likes daily, which resets after 24 hours), SuperLikes, preferences, upgrades (including Dil Details), and other premium features, you&rsquo;ll need to purchase Dil Mil VIP Elite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While VIP Elite does have quite high prices, it offers a better experience on the app, with more access to things, such as the ability to set your filters more aggressively. While this may not seem necessary, if you&rsquo;re looking to filter your matches according to religion, education, community group, or even <em>height</em>, you can with VIP Elite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bear in mind that once you sign up for VIP Elite, you&rsquo;ll only have a very short time period before you&rsquo;ll be charged and all payments go through an automatic renewal process. If you find that VIP Elite doesn&rsquo;t suit your needs, you&rsquo;ll need to cancel the subscription through your app store 24 hours before the end of the free trial period, or you&rsquo;ll be charged the full amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The user base is largely heterosexual, though if you identify as LGBTQIA+, there is still a community on Dil Mil for you. While aimed at South Asians, there are also many users who are from different cultural backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Is Dil Mil a Real Dating Site?</h3>
<p>Yes, Dil Mil is a real dating site! The app has had lots of success introducing couples who have gone on to fall in love and even marry! Just <a href="https://dilmil.co/blog/successstories">check out their success stories</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil was created as an alternative to traditional matchmaking, or introductions through parents. As these are seen as outdated and a sign of the times, the founder of Dil Mil wanted a way to find relationships, rather than hookups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, there are millions of users on the app around the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil is designed to be used on your mobile device, and you can download it from the App Store (for iOS users), or the Google Play store (for Android).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with other dating apps, users may not have multiple accounts, and there are terms of use in place to protect the community. If you violate these terms, you may find your account up for review, or even banned from the app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While there is an appeal process and steps to follow if you disagree with Dil Mil&rsquo;s decision, or feel that you were banned unfairly, whether or not you&rsquo;re reinstated is on a case-by-case basis, and any purchases you&rsquo;ve made will not be refunded.</p>
<h3>Who Uses Dil Mil?</h3>
<p>Dil Mil users tend to be first generation South Asian expats. This includes users who are Indian, Punjabi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://onlineforlove.com/dil-mil-review/#:~:text=Around%20100%20000%20users%20are%20from%20the%20United%20States">Some stats</a> have found that there are around 50,000 active users in the United States of America alone. You&rsquo;ll also find active users in Europe and the south-eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since Dil Mil is designed for those looking for a relationship that could lead to marriage, that means that on average, most users are looking to make meaningful connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While this could mean you meet new friends on the app, it&rsquo;s more likely that you&rsquo;ll be looking for a person for a long-term relationship.</p>
<h3>What Kind of People Use Dil Mil?</h3>
<p>The gender ratio on Dil Mil is pretty even, which is rare for dating apps. Roughly 55% of users identify as male and 45% identify as female.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People using Dil Mil will likely be expats from South Asia, living, studying, or working away from their home country. They&rsquo;ll probably be more highly educated, with at least a college degree, and have more expendable income.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users are likely to be from a wide range of religious backgrounds, interested in connecting with others who have the same beliefs and values. They&rsquo;ll also likely be single and looking for long-term relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are likely to be more heterosexual and gender normative users than queer and non-binary users. However, that&rsquo;s not to say that there isn&rsquo;t a queer community on the app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the majority of users on Dil Mil are South Asian, it isn&rsquo;t exclusive, and there are also other users from other diverse backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Is It Mostly Indian People on Dil Mil?</h3>
<p>Since the app primarily services the South Asian global expat communities, a significant proportion of users are Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Punjabi, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there are also users who are not South Asian, but may be interested in meeting South Asians.</p>
