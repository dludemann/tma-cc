<p>You&rsquo;d be forgiven if Dil Mil was a new dating app to you &mdash; after all, it&rsquo;s not one of the more commonly used dating apps, especially when compared to Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, among the world&rsquo;s South Asian expat singles community, Dil Mil is one of <em>the most</em> well known dating websites, where their many members regularly not only make matches, but find love. In fact, the app receives at least <a href=\"https://dilmil.co/blog/successstories\"><em>one success story per day about their couples</em></a><em>!</em></p>

<h2 id="is-dil-mil-safe?"><a href="#is-dil-mil-safe?">Is Dil Mil Safe?</a></h2>
<p>Put your mind at rest &mdash; in short, yes! Dil Mil is safe to use!</p>

<p>Dil Mil&rsquo;s platform was bought over by the <a href=\"https://socialdiscoverygroup.com/\">Social Discovery Group</a> (formerly Dating Group) in 2010. They also own a number of other well-known niche dating sites, so you can rest assured that they&rsquo;re legit, know what they&rsquo;re doing, and have your security interests at heart!</p>

<p>In fact, a number of features on the Dil Mil app actually prioritize user safety, making it a better place for everyone to meet potential friends, or men and women they&rsquo;d like to date.</p>

<p>As the dating app asks you a number of personal questions about yourself and allows you to set filters in order to help you meet someone (ie, what gender you&rsquo;re interested in, their career, religion, height, and more), potentially for marriage, they also have a comprehensive <a href=\"https://cdn.dilmil.co/static/privacy-policy/pp-2021-06-24.pdf\">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-ways-dil-mil-protect-its-users"><a href="#4-ways-dil-mil-protect-its-users">4 Ways Dil Mil Protect Its Users</a></h2>
<p>Dil Mil&rsquo;s safety features are actually fairly impressive, and rather more extensive than other dating apps out there.</p>

<p>Here are the four main things that they do to make the Dil Mil experience better for everyone, so you can focus on making connections and having conversations with others.</p>
<h3>1. Requires All Users to Verify Account via Phone Authentication</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a Dil Mil account, you can do so either by using a phone number or Facebook account. However, when you do, you&rsquo;ll be required to authenticate your account by phone (you&rsquo;ll be sent a unique code by SMS) or by email.</p>

<p>You can only have one account per phone number.</p>

<p>This process allows the Dil Mil team to ensure that you&rsquo;re a real user, as well as prevent catfish from infiltrating the community.</p>

<p>If you ever deleted your account and then signed up for a new one with the same number, the moderation team would be able to cross-reference your information with your old account, to ensure that your profile matches.</p>

<p>While this doesn&rsquo;t eradicate the presence of catfish and fake profiles entirely, it does significantly reduce them and your chances of coming into contact with them.</p>

<p>You can also choose to go through profile verification, which helps prove to others that you&rsquo;re really who you say you are. Not only that, but if you do, you&rsquo;ll have access to and be able to participate in Mil and Chill, the app&rsquo;s community chat function.</p>
<h3>2. Dil Mil Has an Active Moderation Team</h3>
<p>An active and human moderation team means that any inappropriate content is dealt with quickly, as well as ensuring that everything shown to users adheres to the app&rsquo;s community guidelines.</p>

<p>All photos uploaded to your profile (you can have up to six) are subject to verification by the moderation team, to ensure that their photo <a href=\"https://dilmil.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-dil-mil/faq/184-why-has-my-profile-picture-been-rejected\">guidelines</a> are followed (which include no partial or full nudity, your face is clearly visible in your images, no group pictures, and more).</p>

<p>Our best advice when it comes to your photos is to make sure that they really show you in your best light, which is why we recommend <a href=\"https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me\">getting in touch with The Match Artist</a>!</p>

<p>We specialize in profile pics for your dating profile that <em>really do work!</em> How do we know they do? <a href=\"https://thematchartist.com/case-studies\">Just check out our case studies and reviews</a>!</p>

<p>We know from experience that success on dating apps comes down to that first photo impression, so why not better your chances for meeting <em>the</em> one for life by ensuring your photos are <em>irresistible?</em></p>
<h3>3. Zero Harassment Policy</h3>
<p>With Dil Mil&rsquo;s zero-tolerance policy for harassment, one strike and you&rsquo;re out!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been exchanging a lot of messages with someone, and suddenly their communication turns nasty, you can report them for harassment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once this feedback is received by the moderation team, they&rsquo;ll look into it, and if they find that the person has breached their harassment policy, they&rsquo;ll be banned and unable to create a new account.</p>

<p>Of course, reports shouldn&rsquo;t be taken too lightly, either, and if you simply don&rsquo;t like someone, you can take steps to ensure that they can&rsquo;t contact you again (for example, unmatching or blocking them).</p>

<p>If, however, they are harassing you or behaving inappropriately, take screenshots for proof and ensure they&rsquo;re included in your harassment report.</p>
<h3>4. 3rd Party Data Privacy Rule</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://cdn.dilmil.co/static/privacy-policy/2021-03-17.pdf\">Dil Mil promises that they will not sell your data</a> &mdash; including personal information, payment information, messages, and photos &mdash; to third-party services, whether you have a free or VIP Elite account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This courtesy extends to when you delete your account, as well.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-hide-my-dil-mil-profile-from-dangerous-people?"><a href="#can-i-hide-my-dil-mil-profile-from-dangerous-people?">Can I Hide My Dil Mil Profile From Dangerous People?</a></h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want your profile to be accessible by anyone, you do have the option to hide it from others. To do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to your account screen</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the Settings icon</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the account section</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Toggle &ldquo;Profile Discovery&rdquo; to off.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This will mean that others are unable to see your profile and match with you, but if you&rsquo;ve already matched with others, you can continue chatting with them as normal.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-report-fake-profiles-on-dil-mil"><a href="#how-to-report-fake-profiles-on-dil-mil">How to Report Fake Profiles on Dil Mil</a></h2>
<p>Reporting fake profiles on Dil Mil is very straight forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned, if someone is harassing you (eg, they&rsquo;ve been sending inappropriate messages, too many messages, being abusive, or asking for money), take screenshots so that you can prove it to the Dil Mil Support Team.</p>
<h3>1. Click on a User Profile</h3>
<p>To begin the process, navigate to the profile of the person you&rsquo;d like to report.</p>
<h3>2. Click on the Three Dots in the Top-Right Corner</h3>
<p>This will give you a drop-down box with a few options.</p>
<h3>3. Click &ldquo;Unmatch&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Unmatching is the first step to reporting the profile, and it ensures they won&rsquo;t be able to message you any longer.</p>
<h3>4. Select What Reason You Want to Report a Fake Profile for (Not Interested Anymore, Inappropriate Behavior, Fake Profile/Spam)</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to pick the correct title here so that the moderation team can deal with it appropriately.</p>
<h3>5. Select the Most Appropriate Answer</h3>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not exact, choose the most appropriate answer. If you&rsquo;ve taken screenshots, you can also send these to the moderation team.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts"><a href="#concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</a></h2>
<p>Overall, Dil Mil is a very safe app to use, thanks to the efforts the app&rsquo;s support team have put into it.</p>

<p>However, despite the safety measures they&rsquo;ve put in place, you should still practice good internet dating behavior and safety. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t share personal information publicly, such as your address or phone number</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Being careful which photos you upload, ie. nothing that may reveal places you visit frequently</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Never share your password</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Never send money to strangers</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If in doubt, always block and report!</p>
