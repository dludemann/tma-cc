<h2 id="why-your-first-message-on-dil-mil-is-vital"><a href="#why-your-first-message-on-dil-mil-is-vital">Why Your First Message on Dil Mil is Vital</a></h2>
<p>As with anything, your first impression is of utmost importance. After all, you won&rsquo;t be given chances to make a first impression twice!</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the Dil Mil app, it&rsquo;s no different. Your first message to someone should contain something that the other person is able to respond to, so that you can start getting to know each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.03320.pdf">a study from 2016</a> into heterosexual communication habits on mobile dating apps (MDAs) found that a whopping <em>49%</em> of MDA conversations were unreciprocated. Ie, nearly half of the messages sent never had a response.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s huge!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, only 1% of messages from the study (they looked at data from roughly 2 million conversations consisting of 19 million messages) then led to phone numbers being exchanged.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>So, why is that?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, firstly you have to remember that if you see someone you like on a dating app, chances are you&rsquo;re not the only person who&rsquo;s been drawn to them! And that means competition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Secondly, if your first messages tend to be, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; then you&rsquo;re unlikely to have much success, as it shows no effort, engagement, or interest in the other person.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to get someone&rsquo;s attention, you need to make sure that your first message is:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engaging</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shows some interest in your match</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Worthy of a response!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Your mission, therefore (after making sure that your profile is interesting enough for someone to want to match with you), should be to make sure that your first message gives you a great shot at connecting with the other person!</p>
<h2 id="who-texts-first-on-dil-mil"><a href="#who-texts-first-on-dil-mil">Who Texts First on Dil Mil?</a></h2>
<p>On Dil Mil, unlike with other dating apps such as Bumble, anyone has the ability to slide into their matches&rsquo; inbox first.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The process of matching on Dil Mil is the same as most other apps:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you see someone you like, you swipe right on them. If you want to pass, swipe left</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If they also like what they see and swipe right, the two of you will make a match (congrats!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve matched, you&rsquo;ll be placed in a private chat room and from there you can get to know each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>As long as you match with someone, you&rsquo;ll be able to have unlimited conversations with them, though unfortunately if you want to voice or video chat, you&rsquo;ll need to take this off the app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our opinion, though both of you can message first, if you&rsquo;ve matched with someone, don&rsquo;t delay in sending that first message! As they say: strike while the iron is hot!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sending that first message quickly shows that you&rsquo;re interested in the other person and you&rsquo;re bringing the right energy to your conversation!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-girls-start-conversations-on-dil-mil"><a href="#how-do-girls-start-conversations-on-dil-mil">How Do Girls Start Conversations on Dil Mil?</a></h2>
<p>While, to a certain extent, the way girls can start conversations is very similar to how guys can, there are a few hints and tips that could make it a little easier!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that sending the first message can often be intimidating, especially if you&rsquo;re not used to putting yourself out there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However: <em>the times, they are a-changin&rsquo;!</em> And we recommend that all users, whether female or male, take the plunge, give it a go, and put yourself out there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day, if it leads to healthy and happy relationships, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who sent the first message &mdash; just that it led somewhere!</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a girl sending that crucial first message on Dil Mil:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with a compliment</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly? Guys <em>love</em> compliments. Maybe they have nice eyes, or a good physique, or great hair &mdash; starting with a compliment about their physical attributes is never a bad place to start!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow it up with something you&rsquo;ve noticed from their profile</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Showing real and <em>genuine</em> interest in another person is vital when you&rsquo;re trying to connect. Maybe they have family from your hometown, maybe they went to the same university as you &mdash; use this information to connect with the other person.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep it focused on the other person and keep it short</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first message is not the time to wax lyrical about yourself &mdash; keep it short, simple, and focus on your match.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Finish up with an open-ended question</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ladies, a big secret: guys are a bit simple sometimes! Make it easy for them by giving them something direct to respond to, and not something that would just require a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, many of these tips are applicable whether you&rsquo;re a girl looking to meet a guy, a guy looking to meet a girl, or any other version of &ldquo;person meets person&rdquo; you can think of!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil is primarily aimed at South Asian heterosexual couples, but they do also have an active LGBTQIA+ user base.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-keep-my-dil-mil-chats-interesting"><a href="#how-do-i-keep-my-dil-mil-chats-interesting">How Do I Keep My Dil Mil Chats Interesting?</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to keeping your conversations interesting, focus on getting to know the other person first and becoming friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>People who become friends make great couples, and if you&rsquo;re looking for someone who you could potentially marry, share a life together, and one day have a family with, it&rsquo;s a great idea to get to know them deeply and intimately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some of our top tips for keeping the chat interesting and going:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Follow the lead of the other person to set the tone of the conversation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find common interests to talk about, eg, a shared hobby</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Share a personal story or experience to show the other person that you&rsquo;re willing to be open and vulnerable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be honest and keep an open mind</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you get stuck for conversation, it&rsquo;s okay to take things back to basics, or try a question and answer game, like &ldquo;Two Truths and a Lie&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask open-ended questions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have a good sense of humor, show it off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Keeping the conversation going is all about making sure that you&rsquo;re keeping the other person engaged enough to want to keep talking to you, and that you&rsquo;re able to find a connection so the conversation becomes easy and natural!</p>
<p></p>
<p>And, if you&rsquo;re both feeling it, move things off the app and IRL quickly! That way you can begin to build on what you&rsquo;ve already started and see if the spark is there in person.</p>
<h2 id="easy-first-messages-you-can-try-on-dil-mil"><a href="#easy-first-messages-you-can-try-on-dil-mil">Easy First Messages You Can Try on Dil Mil</a></h2>
<p>So, with all that said, let&rsquo;s get into some examples! Here are our top nine easy first messages you can try out.</p>
<h3>Mention Something You Liked From Their Profile</h3>
<p>It goes without saying, but showing that you&rsquo;ve actually paid attention to information that&rsquo;s been given to you is a good way to begin to connect with someone! And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a physical trait, either &mdash; in fact, it&rsquo;s better if it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe they like reading, or they&rsquo;re a foodie, or interested in industrial design. Bring it into the conversation!</p>
<h3>Discover What Things You Have in Common and Lean Into Them</h3>
<p>Reading the other person&rsquo;s profile carefully will also show you if you have things in common. When you find these nuggets, grab hold and lean into them in your conversation!</p>
<p></p>
<p>While not every couple will share interests and hobbies, if you can find something you enjoy doing together, it&rsquo;ll give you that much more to work with.</p>
<h3>Showcase Your Sense of Humor</h3>
<p>People love other people who can make them laugh. In fact, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/love-digitally/202209/the-importance-humor-in-long-term-relationships">one study found</a> that humor is key to the success of long-term relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hardly surprising, is it? <em>We all love to laugh, and people who make us do so!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>So, keep the first message light and airy, show that you have a sense of humor, and watch the responses come pouring in!</p>
<h3>Ask Your Match About Their Passions</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important when getting to know another person to hold their passions and interests in your regards. If you aren&rsquo;t sure what first message you should send, read through their profile, pay attention to the things that are important to them, and then ask them about it!</p>
<h3>Give Your Match a Genuine Compliment</h3>
<p>The key word here is <em>genuine</em>. A superficial compliment about how they look may be flattering, but &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hot, lol&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t going to cut it! Dig a little deeper and find a genuine compliment to give the other person, and follow it up with an open-ended question.</p>
<h3>Send Your Match a Cute Picture</h3>
<p>A cute picture or meme is a great way to break the ice. And, we&rsquo;re just going to say it &mdash; <em>everybody loves puppies!</em></p>
<h3>Break the Ice With a Fun Icebreaker Question</h3>
<p>A great way to show someone you&rsquo;ve got a great sense of humor and keep things light at the beginning of your conversation, is to start off with a quirky and fun icebreaker.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, &ldquo;<em>If you were a pizza topping, what would you be and why?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or, &ldquo;<em>What would be your three desert island possessions and why?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Ask a Meaningful Question</h3>
<p>Another way to connect with someone is by asking them a meaningful question that&rsquo;ll get them thinking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, &ldquo;<em>Who would you say has had the most impact in your life and why?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Send a GIF</h3>
<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of GIFs, emojis, and memes! Sometimes a picture really <em>is</em> worth a thousand words!</p>

<p>Looking to show off your sense of humor? We&rsquo;ve got you with our best funny conversation starters to try on Dil Mil.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Can I have your picture so I can show Santa what I want for Christmas?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a little cheesy, but it&rsquo;s also bound to get a smile out of the other person and a response. Even better if you use this one close to Christmas!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Do you have a map? I keep getting lost in your eyes.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>While some may argue that this line is a little done to death, as long as you make it clear that you&rsquo;re joking (throw in an emoji or a GIF), you can get away with a cheesy line.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I think you dropped something: my jaw.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This is another line that you need to make clear is a joke, so be sure to include a GIF or emoji! It can be highly effective as a funny compliment as long as you&rsquo;re tasteful with it!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Do you have sunburn, or are you always this hot?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Any line delivered well can be effective if you make sure that you&rsquo;re not cocky! Add an emoji or GIF to make it clear that you&rsquo;re being funny!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;If you were a vegetable, you&rsquo;d be a cute-cumber.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly, it&rsquo;s cute, and it&rsquo;s sweet and short! Throw in an open-ended question at the end and you&rsquo;re onto a winner!</p>
