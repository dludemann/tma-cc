Tinder's new offering, Tinder Select, comes at a significant price of $500 a month and is geared toward a highly select audience.

## But what do you get for the price tag?

Two times a week you can send a message without matching with that particular person.
If you like someone and they don't have any premium version of Tinder, they will see your unblurred picture making you more intriguing, as well as having your profile on the top of their likes for the next week.
If you'd like, you can add "select" to your profile establishing yourself as a premium option for your potential matches.
The select mode will show you to the most desired profiles as judged by Tinder.
Since you have to apply for Select if accepted, you'll be less than 1 percent of users with Select, showing off that you're the highest tier on the dating app.
You'll also be given first access to new features that Tinder is rolling out.
You might think that this price is absolutely outrageous, and I get it. But based on my experiences with many of our clients, if dating is important to them, they will prioritize this part of their life as much as they are able to. It's not desperate, it's just giving yourself the best chance you have with the tools you have at your disposal.

## How Does This Help Tinder's Business?

Fewer people have been subscribing to Tinder lately, although the revenue per user has been rising. The introduction of an elite tier like Tinder Select caters to those willing to invest more in their dating life, which could boost overall revenue. This is a well-known business tactic—segmenting the market and charging based on what each segment is willing to pay.
In 2022, Match Group, Tinder's parent company, acquired The League, a dating app for people with serious career goals. This indicates a broader industry trend toward specialized, premium dating experiences, which our clientele have really appreciated.

## A Win for Premium Clients

For men who invest in premium dating services, like our clients, who opt for high-quality, professionally-taken photos, Tinder Select could be a game-changer. Studies have shown that the first impression made by your dating profile picture is crucial, and high-quality photos significantly boost match rates. Given that these men already stand out due to their top-notch profile aesthetics, a service like Tinder Select amplifies their advantages. It places them in a pool where everyone is taking the process seriously, thereby making matches more meaningful and potentially leading to long-term relationships. For those who have the means and are willing to invest in their dating life, platforms like Tinder Select could offer an optimized experience.

## Not For Everyone

Tinder Select adds another layer to the evolving landscape of online dating by creating a premium tier for those willing and able to pay for it. It also brings up fascinating questions about how we, as a society, are monetizing the complex world of human relationships. But one thing is clear: for those who are willing to invest in love, the benefits could be substantial.

Unfortunately, the premium features on the apps don't work too well unless you have a curated set of pictures to give you a boost. We can help you out here.
