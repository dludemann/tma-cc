<p>If you&rsquo;ve been using dating apps for a while, chances are you&rsquo;ve used &mdash; or at least heard of &mdash; Bumble. Similar to other dating apps, Bumble has been around for almost a decade now, but still manages to stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-people-use-bumble">data shows</a> that there are over 12.3 million monthly active users around the world, with 5.5 million in the U.S. alone. While Tinder may lead the way when it comes to dating apps, Bumble isn&rsquo;t far behind!</p>
