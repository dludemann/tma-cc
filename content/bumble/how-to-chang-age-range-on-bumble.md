<h2>What is Bumble?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble</a> is a social networking app that offers a fresh twist &mdash; ladies take the lead!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike other dating apps, such as Tinder or Hinge, Bumble&rsquo;s dating app is all about empowering women to make the first move. Founded by an ex-Tinder board member, the app was created as a response to the way women often felt harassed on other dating apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Functionally, Bumble operates using the same swiping action as Tinder. However, once users have matched, in heterosexual matches, only the woman has the ability to send the first message. If she doesn&rsquo;t initiate a conversation within 24 hours, the match will disappear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In non-heterosexual matches, either user will have the ability to message first.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, Bumble has branched out from dating and also has Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz, to allow users to make new friends or potential business partners. In these matches, either party is allowed to make the first move.</p>
<h2>Adjusting Age Range on Bumble</h2>
<p>Age preference is an important consideration when dating, as you&rsquo;re more likely to be compatible with someone at a similar age and stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just like you can choose the gender you&rsquo;re attracted to, Bumble lets you switch up your age range preferences to find your perfect match.</p>

<h2>More Bumble and Age-Related Info:</h2>
<p>Of course, how to change your age preference settings is not the only age-related info that you need to know if you&rsquo;re using Bumble.</p>
<h3>At What Age Can You Start Using Bumble?</h3>
<p>To become a part of the Bumble hive and start using the dating app, you need to be at <a href="https://bumble.com/en/help/how-old-do-i-need-to-be-to-use-bumble#:~:text=To%20become%20a%20member%20of,help%20fix%20that%20for%20you!">least 18</a>. It&rsquo;s all about creating a safe, responsible community!</p>
<h3>Does Bumble Have an Age Limit in 2023? What Age is it For?</h3>
<p>As of 2023, Bumble&rsquo;s age policy is that you&rsquo;ve got to be 18 or older to set up an account. There&rsquo;s no upper age limit &mdash; love and connection are for everyone, no matter your age!</p>
<h3>Is Bumble for Teens?</h3>
<p>Sorry, younger teens! Bumble is strictly for the 18-and-over crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact, all popular dating apps, including Tinder and Hinge, are adults only. It&rsquo;s an important rule to keep young teenagers safe.</p>
<h3>What Is Wrong if You Enter the Wrong Age on Bumble?</h3>
<p>If your age is wrong on Bumble, it&rsquo;ll be for one of two reasons &mdash; you entered the wrong age when signing up, or your age is incorrect on your Facebook account.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your data is wrong on Facebook, adjusting it there will fix the issue. If you entered the wrong age at set up, you&rsquo;ll need to reach out to the Bumble moderation panel, and they&rsquo;ll be able to fix it for you.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Modifying Age Preferences on Bumble</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to change your age preferences on Bumble, but changing the age that you&rsquo;re set as yourself may pose a little more of a challenge!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not impossible, it may just take a little extra work and different methods.</p>
<h3>How to Change Your Age Preference on Bumble?</h3>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Change Your Age on Bumble (Facebook Login)?</h3>
<p>If you used Facebook to sign up for Bumble, your age is pulled from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Your-Age-on-Bumble#:~:text=If%20you%20used%20Facebook%20to,change%20your%20age%20on%20Facebook.">Here&rsquo;s how</a> you can change it:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>Edit your profile info to correct your age (you&rsquo;ll find this by going to the &ldquo;Basic Info&rdquo; field)</p>
</li>

<p>Once done, log out of Bumble and then log back in. Bumble should pull the updated age from Facebook!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Change Your Age on Bumble (Phone Number Login)?</h3>
<p>If you signed up to Bumble using a phone number, the process is a little more tricky.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://bumble.com/en/help/my-age-is-wrong">contact the Bumble team</a> directly, and explain to them that your age is wrong on your profile. Let them know your correct DOB, and they&rsquo;ll be able to change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>They will also need you to have your member ID ready to verify your information. To find this head to your Settings, then scroll to the bottom of your profile and tap the Bumble logo three or more times.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Additional Tips for Bumble Users</h2>
<p>Navigating Bumble can be tricky, but we&rsquo;re here to help! Read on to find out our best tips for having success on Bumble.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bumble Profile Tips!</h3>
<h4>Make Sure Your Profile Photos Are Excellent</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only going to follow one piece of advice, follow this one!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Photos are what make or break your online dating experience, and having high quality, flattering and recent photos is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not sure that you have the time or skills to take better photos for your dating profile? <a href="https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me">Get in touch with The Match Artist</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our professional photographers can help you take amazing images for your profile photos. You&rsquo;ll soon see the difference when matches start flooding in!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe us? <a href="https://thematchartist.com/reviews">Check out what some of our past clients have had to say</a>!</p>
<h4>Fill Out Your Whole Profile</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a lackluster profile or bio. Make sure you let your personality shine through, and don&rsquo;t forget the 70:30 rule &mdash; your profile should be 70% about you and 30% about the person you&rsquo;d like to match with!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prompts are also a great way to provide your potential match with a conversation starter &mdash; really, the more info the better! Don&rsquo;t forget to proofread your bio for dodgy English, too &mdash; a profile full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors can be a <em>real turn off.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Including links to your social media content, such as your Instagram or Spotify accounts, can help users get to know you, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to show off your photography and music taste!</p>
<h4>Keep Things Positive</h4>
<p>An upbeat, positive vibe on your profile is a necessity &mdash; no one likes a downer in online dating!</p>
<h4>Make Sure Your Profile Is Current</h4>
<p>Ensure your profile reflects your current interests and lifestyle. If it&rsquo;s full of old images and information, you&rsquo;ll be less likely to meet someone who truly suits who you are &mdash; not to mention that it&rsquo;s a little misleading!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Engage in Conversation</h4>
<p>If a woman messages you, don&rsquo;t just send cheesy pick up lines or the dreaded, &ldquo;Hey&rdquo;! Reply to her questions, send insightful comments and ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your relationship moves off of Bumble and into the real world, also remember to respond to texts!</p>
<h4>Don&rsquo;t Spam or Scam</h4>
<p>It may seem obvious, but <em>don&rsquo;t </em>use Bumble as a way to sell things or get commissions! If people don&rsquo;t like it on social media posts, they <em>certainly</em> don&rsquo;t like it when online dating!</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use Bumble Bizz for networking, but make sure you&rsquo;re not being a nuisance &mdash; it should be about forging genuine business connections, not just trying to sell stuff on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Are There Fake Profiles on Bumble? Is Bumble Full of Fake Profiles?</h3>
<p>While Bumble works hard to keep things legit, no dating app is immune to fake profiles. In fact, plenty of articles, including this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/11lkb1a/so_many_fake_profiles/">Reddit thread</a> bemoan the high number of fake profiles found on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t stress! Bumble has safety features, such as photo verification, to help keep fakes to a minimum.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just be sure to keep an eye out and report if you see something suspicious.</p>
<h3>How Does Bumble Work for Women, How Does Bumble Work for Females?</h3>
<p>Bumble does things a little differently from other dating apps thanks to its requirement that women make the first move &mdash; in heterosexual relationships, anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When a match is made, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move before the match expires. So guys, just sit back, relax, and wait for the women to message you first!</p>
<p></p>
<p>For women, though it can feel like a bit of a daunting task to send that first message, remember: you can only put your best foot forward! Keep it short, snappy, and give them something to respond to.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Bumble is an app that sets itself apart from other dating sites by requiring women to make the first move. This makes a change from other dating sites where men commonly make the first move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Age preference is an important setting on Bumble that can help you find your perfect match.&nbsp; You can adjust it on the app or web page by adjusting the age range slider. This applies to Bumble Bizz and Bumble BFF as well!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bumble is for adults only &mdash; no one aged under 18 can use it. There is no upper limit, however!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you notice your profile is set to the wrong age, you can either adjust it by changing your age on Facebook, or by contacting the Bumble team directly, if you&rsquo;ve not linked your Facebook to your Bumble account.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a successful Bumble experience, make sure your profile is complete, up to date, and that you&rsquo;ve got the best possible photographs!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to ensure your photographs are the best they can be is to <a href="https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me">get in touch with The Match Artist</a>. Our professional photographers will spend four to five hours with you on your personal photoshoot, taking a variety of images in locations, outfits, and times of the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not everyone is a natural model &mdash; believe us, we&rsquo;ve seen it all! That&rsquo;s why we offer facial expression coaching, so that no matter how you want to be perceived, we can make sure your photos reflect that. All it takes is a little coaching and a little practice in front of the mirror!</p>
<p></p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; we&rsquo;ll still be on hand on the day to make sure that no hair is out of place, and every look is <em>giving! </em>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how good you look, and <a href="https://thematchartist.com/case-studies">the results will speak for themselves</a>!</p>
