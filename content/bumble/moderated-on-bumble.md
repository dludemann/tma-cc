<p>On Bumble, when a profile or content is marked as "moderated," it means that the material has been reviewed by the platform&rsquo;s moderation team. This can happen for a variety of reasons. Perhaps another user reported suspicious activity or the content violated Bumble's guidelines. The review process ensures that content aligns with the app's community standards, which are in place to safeguard users from inappropriate content, harassment, or any other form of misuse.</p>
<p>If your content or profile is moderated, it doesn't necessarily mean you've done something wrong. It might just be a routine check or a false alarm. However, it's always a good idea to review Bumble's community guidelines to ensure you're in compliance.</p>
