    pre_title: The Importance of
    title: Professional Dating Photography
    paragraphs:
      - text: >-
          One of the most common questions we get is, "Is dating photography a
          thing?" Yes, it is quite literally a thing and the best thing ever for
          someone in the dating game. If you are unable to find the match that
          you want or are being looked over by women or men even on an app like
          Tinder, then it's important to take a close hard look at those dating
          photos. In fact, with many dating platforms being picture first, like
          Tinder, the prospect's first impression of your profile picture needs
          to be the best it can. It would help if you made a good enough
          impression for the prospect to tap on your picture profile and browse
          through some of those other pictures you uploaded before reading the
          bio.


          The vast majority of people on Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, for example,
          will never read the bio without first being lured in by a photo that,
          for them, has potential. It is often subtle cues that signal to a
          prospect they should take a closer look at you. Dating photography
          specializes in making sure that not only are you seen in the best
          light, but that those subtle cues are more prominent. That's why
          dating photography is an instrumental part of building a dating
          profile that helps you attract the right people. However, a lot more
          goes into dating photography, which includes research into what
          attracts the people you want to date. Everyone is different and is
          attracted to an entirely different set of physical or facial
          attributes. It goes without saying that specific facial and physical
          attributes are more attractive for some people than others.


          Dating photographs need to be honest and show off those so-called
          "best attributes" without appearing overdone. Yes, we know it's
          confusing, but there is often a thin line between having an attractive
          dating photograph or one that comes across as being extensively
          edited. Today, people are much more capable of spotting a doctored
          image, which will almost always take points off your credibility
          score. If anything, you never want to come across as being dodgy in
          your dating profile.


          Interestingly, when you hire a professional dating photographer, you
          are getting an edge over the competition, especially considering that
          85% of people on dating websites use selfies. Many also have photos
          taken by someone they are close to and—worst of all—use a multitude of
          filters, all of which work to their disadvantage.


          As dating photographers, we know that you have about 3 seconds to make
          an initial, great impression. Those initial 3 seconds can make or
          break your profile. That's why we work so hard to make sure our
          clients send out the right subliminal cues. Our dating photographers
          help you gain those extra seconds (long enough for the prospect to
          read your bio). Speaking of which, we tend to think your pictures a
          lot more critical than your bio, but a well-written bio will mean that
          a lot of those prospects attracted by your dating profile picture are
          motivated to contact you. The first step to ensuring that we get your
          dating profile right is to consult with us. Dating photography
          requires us to create a profile of who you're trying to attract and
          then take photos just for them. It isn't uncommon for us to take
          several dozen photos before we short through to figure out which ones
          will have the most impact.

    title: Who needs online dating photography for their online dating profile?
    paragraphs:
      - text: >-
          Based on what you've read so far, you would assume that everyone needs
          online dating photography to find the right match. In reality, that's
          not the case. While everyone can benefit from professional online
          dating photography, just like everyone can use a new car, some people
          benefit from it more than others.


          For instance, a young woman in her early to mid-20s can get away with
          selfies. Even average-looking young women may not have to invest in
          professional online dating photography. Often, young women looking for
          more mature men don't need anything other than a few selfies because,
          for many older men, that's enough. According to some experts, an
          increasingly fewer number of men read women's dating profiles; they
          swipe and message if it's a young woman in decent physical condition.
          That's why many women in their 20s are overwhelmed with messages and
          dating offers, so much so that they have to block people online.


          On the flip side, younger men don't receive as much attention. Young
          men in their late to early 20s are seen as being immature. The selfies
          don't help their case either, because most women just swipe past them
          since it's similar to every other frat boy or young man to them. Even
          posting pictures of your six-pack will only get you so far. Don't get
          us wrong, most women aren't looking for a guy with a potbelly, puffed
          up face, or someone who likes dressing up as a cosplay character, but
          maturity matters. As professional photographers, we know what
          attributes attract women. Whether it's an older man or a young man,
          highlighting those attributes will help attract women of the right age
          and type.
        inline_image:
        flipped: false
      - text: >-
          So, here are a couple of examples of men and women who can benefit
          significantly from a professionally created online dating profile:


          **Young Men Looking for Women Their Age** – If you don't want to be
          overlooked by women your age, you have to signal your maturity. Men in
          their 20s can appear more mature with the right pose, facial
          expressions, and clothes. Fortunately, here too, we've helped scores
          of our clients find more dates by simply changing the way they look in
          their dating profiles—in some cases, very subtly.
        inline_image: /images/work/connor-grid.jpeg
        flipped: false
      - text: >-
          **Below Average Looking Men** – Honestly, we firmly believe that there
          is no such thing as an average-looking man. Every man is different and
          can attract a woman by exuberating the right subtle cues in their
          dating profile photographs. The key is for us to use our experience to
          best present you to your target audience in a way that gets them
          hooked. It can often take several pictures after a consultation to
          shortlist those few photographs that we think will make you stand out.


          **Older Women Looking For Men** – Career women in their early to late 30s,
          40s, and 50s are often overlooked by men their age. It's not always
          because they could look younger, but that these women don't show off
          those subtle cues that attract the men they want. Our approach to
          online dating photography for women is to understand the type of men
          they want to date, create a profile, and then start the actual
          photography. Each photograph is geared to that profile. The right
          approach, which means successfully presenting those subtle cues in an
          online dating profile bio, has, in our experience, delivered excellent
          results for clients.

          **Anyone Who Has Not Seen Results** – By this, we mean anyone who has had
          an online dating profile for a while across multiple platforms but has
          not seen much in the way of results. This could also include older men
          and women returning to the dating game after a significantly long
          hiatus. Most likely, you are an older male since women swipe on only
          6% of male profiles. Also, women who haven't been able to attract the
          type of man they want can benefit significantly from professional
          online dating photography.

          ## Dating profile pictures photography - 5 must-have dating photos for success 


          Each day we meet with men and women who feel anxious about
          getting back into the dating game. Men and women who have been in a
          single relationship for a long time are often the hardest hit. While
          we advocate that you kick off your online dating journey with
          professional dating profile pictures, the other question we often get
          asked is, "What types of pictures work best?" In our experience, there
          are 5 types of photos that your profile should have and are offered as
          part of our dating profile pictures photography service.

          ## The Headshot with a Smile 


          99.9% of people visiting your online
          dating profile will start by seeing your headshot. Whether it's
          Tinder, Bumble, or Facebook, that headshot gives a prospect their
          first impression of you. In the world of dating profile picture
          photography, pulling off a truly fantastic headshot needs more than
          just a beautiful simile. It needs to be interesting and intriguing
          enough to get a prospect to tap or swipe on it. So you don't want a
          headshot that resembles more of a close-up. The picture is usually
          framed from the chest up. Also, this isn't a passport photo, so try to
          smile. If anything, it goes a long way to make the person considering
          your profile feel more comfortable. The blurred background is fine
          since the emphasis is on you. But the most critical element, second to
          perhaps your smile, is the lighting. We try to avoid using overhead
          lights, which make the features appear too harsh. Our team uses
          eye-level lights which accentuate your facial features. Also, the goal
          is to produce a portrait that does not look flat. That's why it
          generally takes a pretty long time to frame and take what we consider
          to be a winning headshot for a dating profile.

          ## A Candid Portrait 


          Candid photos are an excellent way to show off
          your personality. When done right, or professionally (we must add), it
          will impress people who are looking to find someone who likes having
          fun. Candid shots, by their very definition, need to be taken when the
          subject isn't aware they are being photographed. The majority of
          candid shots are faked, and the subject tries acting natural, which is
          perfectly fine if it is pulled off with perfection.

          Our dating profile pictures photography service achieves candid shots
          with careful planning and positioning. We also find the right angle
          for the shot to get that impromptu look. In our experience, it helps
          immensely if the shot is of you engaged in some activity like maybe
          fetching drinks from the counter, playing the guitar, etc. However,
          the key is to get our clients to relax and rehearse the shot before it
          is taken.

          ## Shots of Your Hobbies 


          We don't mean pictures of your stamp
          collection, but instead, you engaged in pasting stamps, maybe. While
          platforms like Tinder have proven to be instrumental in connecting
          people, the opportunity to learn about the other party is almost
          non-existent without contacting them. However, you can communicate
          your hobbies and passion via a series of photographs. If you like
          reading, playing the guitar, or doing Pilates, a few photos in your
          natural habitat helps communicate to the prospect what you enjoy
          doing.

          As professional photographers, we know that every picture tells a
          story. That's why our goal is to try and convey as much information as
          possible. Also, these photos help you steer clear from the otherwise
          monotonous, repetitive rut other profiles seem to find themselves in.
          So this is an opportunity for you to connect with a prospect, which
          ideally is a like-minded person who shares your passion.

          ## A Full Body Shot 


          We usually recommend a full body shot to avoid any
          misunderstandings. A full body shot shows off how you look. However,
          as dating photographers, these are among the hardest to get right
          because you need to find the right pose, optimal angle, and the best
          lighting, not to mention get the look right.

          Ideally, you'll want to take the shot outdoors, an hour or so before
          sunset. Again, the primary light source is set at eye level, making it
          the best time for this natural light shot. Though if the same shot
          were to be taken indoors, we'd use artificial lighting that's at
          eye-level with a wide aperture lens. Our goal is to get everything
          from the waist up in the frame while blurring out the background to
          eliminate distractions.
