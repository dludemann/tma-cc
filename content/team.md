      - title: Shane White
        subtitle: Founder
        description:
          Shane is the founder of a software company and a popular wedding DJ company.
          Shane’s passion for The Match artist started when Nick shot some photos one night
          and suggested he uploaded them to Tinder. After many dates later, he had a girlfriend
          and thought he could be helpful to other guys in search of love and relationships.
          In addition to being full time at The Match Artist, Shane enjoys piloting his
          plane, and running every day of the week. He guarantees your experience with The
          Match Artist will be memorable.
